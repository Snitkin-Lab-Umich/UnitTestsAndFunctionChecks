# Unit Tests and Function Checks

This repository is to help lab members learn about input validation (function checks) and unit tests. The code in this repository was used for a demonstration during lab meeting. 



## Note: 
To add unit test functionality to your R package run
```
usethis::use_testthat()
```
This command will generate a subdirectory called `tests/testthat/` where you will write your test files. 

For unit testing you can create as many files as you like: one for each function, one for each lib file, or one long file. Make sure your test files are named test_*.R
